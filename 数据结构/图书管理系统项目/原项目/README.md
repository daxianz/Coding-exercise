## Library Information Management System

### 1. Reasons for this project.

I'm a freshman of Electrical Information Innovation Experiment Class 2016 fall, [Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](http://ee.dlut.edu.cn/en_.htm), [Dalian Univ. of Tech.](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) and this project is the curriculum design of "C language course". 

I have done it for a week attentively, so I hope you can enjoy it. The screenshots of using are as follows:

### 2. Comments and Considerations

* The enviroment I developed this project on Windows that time. So if you are Linux or macOS user, maybe you can't run this project code normally. 

* Do your homework for yourself. You can learn for reference, but it's better not to plagiarize.

### 3. Encoding format

.C Text is encoded with **UTF-8**, But the .text Text is encoded with **GBK**. Maybe you will find error about text format. You can change all text format to **UTF-8**, maybe solve it.

### 4. Support

Compile Enviorment:
  1. windows 10 && Gcc 4.8 (ensure OK! But have some warnings.)
  2. Apple macOS 14.1 && clang (sorry, have a little error, you can solve by yourself.)

### 5. Helps

If you have any question, please pull up some issues and requests.
